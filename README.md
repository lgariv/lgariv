# Hi there 👋

My name is Lavie, I'm 20 years old and I'm an Electrical Engineer, with specialization in telecommunication systems.

#### 👨‍💻 I’m currently working on:
* My final college project - a device that can connect externally to automatic doors, and will permit entry only if the person client wears a mask and has a valid body temperature.
Involves Python, TensorFlow 2, OpenCV, and more.
* [Selenium](https://github.com/lgariv/selenium/), [Prog](https://github.com/lgariv/Prog/), [SeeYa](https://github.com/lgariv/seeya/) iOS jailbreak tweaks.

#### 📚 Aside from my degree, I'm currently learning:
* Machine Learning and TensorFlow (Keras specifically).
* Python.
* iOS front-end app development (Swift 5 and SwiftUI).

#### 🤹‍♂️ I have good skills in:
* C, and Objective-C programming languages.
* Arduino and Micro-controllers in general.
* iOS Jailbreak tweak development.
